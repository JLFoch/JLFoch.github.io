    <h2>The winner is <a href="https://www.godaddy.com"> GoDaddy</a></h2>
    <p>The top host I have picked is GoDaddy. There are a few different reasons for this. A huge one is that you do not need any web design background to make a great looking site using GoDaddy’s services. I use their ecommerce website builder because I had no clue how to build a sire from the ground up. The website builder is just so easy to use and you can go so many different things. Although it is limited, they have tons of options. I also like that GoDaddy has 24/7 tech support, this is great for any business. GoDaddy pricing is also pretty good considering you get a lot of different things even with the basic plans. If you have the ability to build a site from the ground up there are plans for that too. There are plans for all skill sets and price ranges. </p>
